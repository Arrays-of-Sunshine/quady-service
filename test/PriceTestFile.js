 * This is where I would test the Price component
 * I would check if it is displaying the price
 * I would check if it is displaying the price correctly if there is a sales/discount
 * I would check if it is not incorrectly displaying the price
 * --Make sure it does not try to display a discount price when there is no discount
 * --Make sure it does not try to display the normal price when there is a discount
